C++ Program for Stack Operations Using Arrays

What is Stack?
Stack is a LIFO (last in first out) structure. It is an ordered list of the same type of elements. A stack is a linear list where all insertions and deletions are permitted only at one end of the list.
When elements are added to stack it grow at one end. Similarly, when elements are deleted from a stack, it shrinks at the same end.
It involves various operations such as push,pop,stack empty,stack full and display.
Below is the source code for C++ Menu Driven Program for Stack Operations Using Arrays which is successfully compiled and run on Windows System to produce desired output as shown below :
