Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 

Example 1:


Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
  
  
Solution : 
Time Complexity : O(n*n)
  
Using set:

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        vector<set<int>>rows(9),cols(9),blocks(9);
        
        for(int i=0;i<9;i++) //rows
        {
            for(int j=0;j<9;j++) //coloumns
            {
                if(board[i][j]=='.')
                    continue;
                
                int curr = board[i][j]-'0';
                if(rows[i].count(curr) || cols[j].count(curr) || blocks[(i/3)*3+j/3].count(curr))
                    return false;
                
                rows[i].insert(curr);
                cols[j].insert(curr);
                blocks[(i/3)*3+j/3].insert(curr);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
