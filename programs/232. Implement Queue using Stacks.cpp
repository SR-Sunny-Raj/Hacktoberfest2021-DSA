Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

Solution :

class MyQueue {
public:
    stack<int>s1,s2;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MyQueue() {
        
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    void push(int x) {
        while(!s1.empty())
        {
            s2.push(s1.top());
            s1.pop();
        }
        
        s2.push(x);
        while(!s2.empty())
        {
            s1.push(s2.top());
            s2.pop();
        }
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    int pop() {
        int curr = s1.top();
        s1.pop();
        return curr;
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    int peek() {
        return s1.top();
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    bool empty() {
        return s1.empty();
    }
};

/**
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyQueue* obj = new MyQueue();
 * obj->push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj->pop();
 * int param_3 = obj->peek();
 * bool param_4 = obj->empty();
 */

Time Complexity : O(1) for push, O(n) for pop() and top().
So overall time complexity - O(n) where n is the number of elements.
Space Complexity - O(2*n) which is approx. O(n)
